Many thanks to the following people who supplied bug reports, patches,
helpful comments, constructive death threats, and what not:

Version 0.3.2:

* Stephen Graham for proposing the -q option (even though I already
  needed it), and for spotting the foreground option that
  wouldn't.

Version 0.4:

* Added patch from http://www.digriz.org.uk/debian/fujitsu/t2010 (support
  for switch events).
